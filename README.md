This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  This simple example highlights the importance of null pointer checks to prevent crashes and undefined behavior in C++ programs.
